wordle.py takes in the grey, yellow and green letters and splits out the most likely next alternative words. This is cheating. Use your knowledge of words instead!

starterwordle.py calculates the most common letters used in a particular dictionary of words. Lists the letter most likely to give a hit on the first wordle guess.

filterwords.py isolates and formats all the five letter words in a given text dictionary. Useful in creating 5letter word only dictionaries.

vowelplacings.py shows a table of distribution of vowel occurances in each letter position for all words from a given dictionary. Helpful in choosing your next word.
